Project Description: Quiz Game with PyQt GUI

The "Quiz Game with PyQt GUI" is an interactive Python project that aims to engage users in a fun and educational quiz game. The project uses the PyQt library to create a graphical user interface, allowing users to interact with the game easily. The game presents users with a series of multiple-choice questions and records their responses, providing immediate feedback on their accuracy.

Key Features:

Graphical User Interface: The project utilizes the PyQt library to create an attractive and user-friendly GUI. The window displays one question at a time, along with radio buttons for the multiple-choice options and a "Submit" button.

Randomized Quiz: The quiz questions are randomized for each playthrough, enhancing replayability and avoiding predictability.

Score Tracking: The application keeps track of the user's score throughout the quiz, indicating the number of correct answers.

Time-efficient Gameplay: Each question is associated with a timer, and users must answer within the allocated time. If they don't respond in time, the application moves to the next question automatically.

Instant Feedback: Users receive instant feedback on the correctness of their answers after clicking the "Submit" button. Correct answers are rewarded with points, and incorrect answers prompt the correct option to be displayed.

How It Works:

Upon starting the application, users are presented with a welcome screen displaying the title "Quiz Game."
After pressing "Start" or a similar button, the main quiz window appears, showing the first question along with the multiple-choice options.
Users can select one option by clicking the corresponding radio button and click the "Submit" button to proceed to the next question.
The application records the user's score as they progress through the quiz.
If the user does not answer within the time limit for a question, the game automatically moves to the next question.
Once all questions have been answered, the quiz concludes, and a message box displays the user's final score.
Project Scope:
The "Quiz Game with PyQt GUI" project covers the implementation of a basic quiz game with a graphical user interface using the PyQt library. While the current version uses a pre-defined set of sample questions, it can be expanded by incorporating a database to store a more extensive range of questions and topics. The project also allows room for additional features, such as a timer countdown displayed on the screen or a high-score leaderboard.

Overall, the "Quiz Game with PyQt GUI" project provides an enjoyable and educational experience for users, fostering their knowledge retention while offering an interactive and visually appealing user interface. The project serves as an excellent starting point for Python beginners to delve into GUI development and showcases the versatility of PyQt for creating interactive applications.
